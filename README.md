- 👋 Hi, I’m @bocajdraw
- 👀 I’m interested in using AI systems like ChatGPT to create code, because I wrote a book about how AI is changing human behavior.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bit of Python in order to play around.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting ChatGPT-driven projects.
- 📫 I'm at @byjacobward on Twitter and Insta, DMs are open!
